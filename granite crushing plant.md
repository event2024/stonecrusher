Due to the high hardness of granite, it is necessary to adopt the cone crusher for the secondary crushing. Tertiary crusher is optional and it has features of high crushing ratio, high efficiency, and high handling capacity. Last but not least, impact crusher is used for the production of high-quality sand and stone aggregate for the construction of highways, high-speed railways, and concrete mixing plants.</p><p>To increase the production capacity of your granite crushing plant, you should optimize the design of your crushing system that suits your plant. By cutting down unnecessary elments, such as screens, dump trucks and double cycles, you can focus on optimizing other devices within your machine. In addition, you should also consider implementing advanced control systems that can help in monitoring and optimizing the plant's productivity.</p><p>Besides choosing the right design for your granite crushing plant, you should also consider other factors when starting your business.
